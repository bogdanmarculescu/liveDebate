### The goal of this project is to be a demo/example used in the PG3402 course at Kristiania

### Description

The idea is to have a small game that will reflect a debate between two or more candidates. 

A debate will take place in several rounds. In each round, candidates simultaneously choose their action for that round. 
A resolver component decides the outcome of the round and the impact on the overall debate.

### Services so far:
- candidates - handles candidate names and information
- resolver - handled the resolution of a debate round



### Architecture thoughts and concepts
